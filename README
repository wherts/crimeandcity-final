Hi grader!

I see you have unzipped my submission and found your way to the README. Nice! This directory contains all of my original code, the data I downloaded (see the csv folder) and the data I generated (see the json folder) from the census data I used. I'd love it if you took the time to check out some of the ways I organized the data and the code I wrote, if that's of interest to you.

To check out my final project, go to your browser (it should work on any browser but please use Google Chrome to be safe) and navigate to:
https://wherts.github.io
My final project is hosted here and is available for your grading and use! Take a look at what I built and play around with the visualizations as much as you'd like.
